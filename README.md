## About
Using this repository to log my experience with Advent of Code 2025 as I attempt to complete all of this year's challenges.

---

Each day will have its own folder ('Day-x') which will contain the main content, in terms of code, that I did to solve the exercise.
This repository includes only the code for solving the exercises. Inputs are not included.
